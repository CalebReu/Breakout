# COSC416 Studio 5: Polish and Build

In this studio, we added "juice" to a basic prototype of the classic arcade game _Breakout_. This gave us experience with the polishing stage of game development, taught us how to build a Unity project so that it may be shared on a platform like itch.io, and allowed us to experience working as a team prior to the Game Jam.

## Team members and roles

We are Team Galagang (AKA Group 26 on Canvas). Here is who did what:

- Kaedyn: Particle effects
- Caleb: Add a face (eyes and mouth) to the paddle
- Ariana: Sound effects & music
- Jackson: UI/HOD
